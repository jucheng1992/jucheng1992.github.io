		          Unsupervised Learning for Dialectometric Analysis
		          
		        </strong>
		        <br>
		        <br>In this project, we apply unsupervised learning method to dialectometric analysis of the Harvard Dialect Survey conducted in 2003. We use the Pearson independence test to evaluate the similarity of each pair of questions and use Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to visualize the relationship. We also identify some highly correlated pairs for further analysis. Then we use PCA for dimension reduction and visualize the data based on PCA. We apply several clustering algorithms and visualize the results on the map. Based on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) model in in information retrieval and text mining, we propose a new distance metric and use k-medoids model based on new distance.
