      This project mainly focuses on distinguish gut, yolk, and epidermal/mesodermal tissue in embryo images. Construct features from the raw embryo image based on computer vision method (e.g. Histogram oriented gradient feature and Local Binary Pattern) using scikit-image in python. Select features based on variable importance from Random Forest and Tree Boosting.	Apply different machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Tree boosting, Lasso, SVM) to classify the organ.

      In this project, we apply unspervised learning to the dialectometric analysis of the Harvard Dialect Survey conducted in 2003.
      We use Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to visualize the relationship of the questions.  Based on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) model, we propose a new distance metric and use k-medoids model to find out the sub-culture in America.
