      In this project, we apply unspervised learning to the dialectometric analysis of the Harvard Dialect Survey conducted in 2003.
      We first use the Pearson independence test to evaluate the similarity of each pair of questions and use Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to visualize the relationship.  Based on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) model in in information retrieval and text mining, we propose a new distance metric and use k-medoids model to find out the sub-culture in America.
